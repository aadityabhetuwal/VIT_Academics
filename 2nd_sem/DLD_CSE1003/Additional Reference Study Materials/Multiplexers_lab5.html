</p><p><b><font size="+1">Objectives:</font></b>
</p><p>In this laboratory you will
</p><ol>
<li>
use a counter to generate a test data sequence.</li>

<li>
use a multiplexer in two different ways.</li>
</ol>

<ul>
<ul>
<li>
You will use it as a switch to connect different inputs to a single wire.</li>

<li>
You will use it as a building block for logic circuits</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<ol>
<li>
use a logic analyzer to view the test sequence and the multiplexer output.</li>
</ol>
<b><font color="#FF0000"><font size="+1">Prelab:</font></font></b>
<p><b>Input generator circuit using a counter:</b>
</p><p>The logic function that will be built in this lab could be tested by
connecting the three inputs to three switches and stepping through all
8 possible input combinations manually. However, in this lab the testing
will be automated slightly. Refer to the instructions for <a href="http://www.ee.scu.edu/classes/2002winter/elen021/labs/specs/conn191.html">connecting
a 74191 counter&nbsp;</a> which uses a 74191 counter chip and a 7404 hex
inverter to generate a binary counting sequence. (These instructions include
a layout of the two chips showing all wires.) These outputs will be used
as inputs for your multiplexer circuit. This counter circuit will need
a clock input at a low frequency to cause the output to count up slowly
enough to be observed visually.
</p><dir><b>Prelab for Test circuit:</b></dir>

<ul>
<li>
Print the instructions and read through them carefully.</li>

<li>
Clearly identify which outputs will be used for Circuits 1 and 2. Label
the outputs X, Y and Z where <b>X is the most slowly changing counter output.</b></li>
</ul>
<b>Circuit 1 - Multiplexer as a switch:</b>
<p>A multiplexer (MUX) is basically a switch which connects one of <i>2<sup>n</sup></i>MUX
data inputs to a single output. The <i>n</i> select inputs of the MUX determine
which of the MUX data inputs will appear at the MUX output. Often a MUX
also has an enable input. If the MUX is not enabled, none of the data inputs
appear on the MUX output. The first circuit you build will select one of
four numbers to be displayed.
</p><p>You will use the eight data switches of the breadboard to make four
two-bit numbers. The first will be SW1, SW2 and the fourth will be SW7,
SW8. Two 4:1 MUXes will be used to select which two-bit number appears
at the MUX outputs.
</p><dir><b>Prelab for Circuit 1:</b></dir>

<ul>
<li>
Read the data sheets for the <a href="http://www.ee.scu.edu/classes/2002winter/elen021/labs/specs/ds74151.htm">74LS151</a>,
an 8:1 MUX, and the <a href="http://www.ee.scu.edu/classes/2002winter/elen021/labs/specs/ds74153.htm">74LS153</a>,
a dual 4:1 MUX. Note that both components have an input labeled "strobe"
which can disable outputs.</li>

<li>
Draw the schematic for the switch.</li>

<ul>
<li>
Add a 74153 from the Xilinx Spartan library. Clearly label the pin numbers
and wires for this chip.Note that a 74153 has two 4:1 MUXes.</li>

<li>
Label the one MUX output&nbsp; MSB, for most significant bit. It should
be the switch for the odd numbered data input switches.</li>

<li>
Label the the other MUX output&nbsp; LSB, for least significant bit. It
should be the switch for the even numbered data input switches.</li>
</ul>

<li>
Show how the switches will be connected to 4 data inputs of each of the
two 4:1 MUXes of the 74153 so that the desired number will appear at the
MUX outpust.</li>

<li>
The two select lines will come from two of the counter outputs. Pick the
most slowly changing counter outputs. Which would these be? Why do we pick
these outputs ?</li>
</ul>
<b>Circuit 2 - Parity generator:</b>
<p>A multiplexer can be used as a standard building block to implement
any desired logic function. For a function with n inputs, if the number
of selects is at least (n-1) this implementation does not require any minimization
techniques. Further, if the specification of the logic function changes,
the circuit can be modified by simply changing the MUX data inputs corresponding
to the changed truth table values.
</p><p>Consider a circuit to be used for binary information&nbsp; transmission
using three bits D2, D1 and D0. Here D2 is the most significant data bit.
In order to be able to detect single bit errors in transmission, an extra
bit P is to be added to the binary message to make the number of ones odd
in the transmitted output. This output P is a function of 3 variables and
can be created with a 4:1 MUX.
</p><dir><b>Prelab for Circuit 2:</b></dir>

<ul>
<li>
Draw the truth table for the odd parity generator just described with the
three bits D2, D1 and D0 as the inputs and the odd parity bit P as the
output.</li>

<li>
Design the odd parity generator using a 4 to 1 MUX with D2 and D1 as selects.</li>

<li>
Add the diagram for Circuit 2 to your previous diagram. Use another 4:1
MUX from another 74153 for the circuit, <b>although in lab you will reuse
the same part.</b></li>

<li>
Show clearly what will be connected to the 4 data inputs of the 4:1 Mux
so that the desired logic function will be implemented by the MUX.</li>

<li>
The inputs D2, D1 and D0 to Circuit 2 are outputs X,Y and Z of the counter
of the test circuit. Connect the select inputs of the 74153 for this circuit
in the same way as was done for circuit 1.</li>
</ul>
Print the circuit diagram and submit it with your Prelab. Be sure that
<b>all components have pin numbers assigned</b>. This is necessary for
efficient circuit implementation and debugging.
<p><b><font color="#FF0000"><font size="+1">Lab:</font></font></b>
</p><ol>
<li>
Read the laboratory instructions carefully. You may not begin the laboratory
if you have not completed the Prelab</li>

<li>
Set up the <a href="http://www.ee.scu.edu/classes/2002winter/elen021/labs/specs/conn191.html">counter
circuit </a>to generate all possible combinations of four inputs.</li>
</ol>

<ul>
<ul>
<li>
Connect all four inverted counter outputs and the clock to LEDs so that
you can observe the binary counting sequence.</li>

<li>
Also connect the two most significant bits of the inverted counter output
to the lower seven segment display so that you can see the select sequence
00, 01, 10, 11 as a decimal digit display 0, 1, 2, 3.</li>

<li>
Put <b>one</b> 74153 on your breadboard and connect the switches to the
inputs in the manner you designed for your prelab for Circuit 1. Make sure
your chip has power and ground and that it is enabled.</li>
</ol>

<ul>
<ul>
<li>
Connect the MUX outputs to the upper seven segment display to show the
selected number</li>

<li>
Test your circuit as follows: (It is not possible to test all 2<sup>10</sup>=1024
possible input combinations in the lab. Although a logic analyzer could
be used to test them all, we would still have to verify the outouts. We
will do some strategic testing that is likely to catch most errors.)</li>

<ul>
<li>
Set all of the switches to zero and observe that the MUX outputs are always
zero while the selects count 0, 1, 2, 3, 0,....</li>

<li>
Set all of the switches to one and observe that the MUX outputs are always
one (i.e.the decimal number 3) while the selects count 0, 1, 2, 3, 0,....
If the outputs are still all zeros, check the power, ground, and enable
of your chip.</li>

<li>
Set switch SW1 to a logic 1 while all other switches remain at 0. Observe
and record the MUX outputs as a function of selects by observing the seven
segment displays. What are they? What should they be?</li>

<li>
Repeat this test for the other 7 swirches. Set each switch to a 1 while
all the others are 0 and verify that the outputs are correct. This is a
good way to identify switched MUX input wires (connections).</li>

<li>
Set two switches SW2 and SW3 to logic 1 while all other switches remain
at 0. Observe and record the MUX outputs. What are they? What should they
be?</li>

<li>
Compare your '153 implementation of the parity generator circuit to an&nbsp;
8 to 1 MUX design using&nbsp; the '151. What are the advantages and disadvantages
of each in terms of building the circuit? How many chips are needed for
each? How many wires are needed for each?</li>

<li>
Each of the two 4:1 MUXes on the '153 has its own enable (strobe). Show
how to connect a '153 using the strobe for the third select input to an
additional two input OR and an inverter so that the circuit with the two
4:1 MUXes will function like a single 8:1 MUX.</li>

<li>
You are asked to enhance Circuit 1. This requires that you display four
three-bit numbers A2A1A0, B2B1B0, C2C1C0 and D2D1D0 cyclically at the outputs.
How would you connect the numbers to the data inputs of&nbsp; 74153s. You
can assume that the select inputs are still connected to the counter outputs
and that twelve data input switches are available.</li>

<li>
You are asked to make a circuit similar to Circuit 1 which will display
one of two four bit numbers cyclically on a display. How many MUXes will
you need? What size MUXes will you need?</li>

<li>
For the function f(A,B,C)=<font face="Symbol">S</font>m(3,5,6,7):&nbsp;
(Note <font face="Symbol">S</font> should be a summation sign)</li>

<br>a.) Show a 4:1 MUX implementation of the function f(A,B,C) with (i)B
and C as selects (ii)with A and C as selects (iii)with A and B as selects.
Are any of these three implementations more efficient than the other two?
<br>b.) Using the Shannon expansion theorem, write the algebraic equations
for the implementation in part(a).
<br>c.) Show a 2:1 MUX implementation of the function f(A,B,C) with&nbsp;
(i) C as the select (ii) with B as the select (iii) with A as the select.
Are any of these three implementations more efficient than the other two?
<br>d.) Using the Shannon expansion theorem, write the algebraic equations
for the implementation in part(c).
<br>e.) Recall that this same function f(A,B,C) )=<font face="Symbol">S</font>m(3,5,6,7)=
AB + AC + BC can be implemented using AND/OR gates. Which of the seven
implementations: (a-i), (a-ii), (a-iii), (c-i), (c-ii), (c-iii), or (e)
would you prefer and why?</ol>
