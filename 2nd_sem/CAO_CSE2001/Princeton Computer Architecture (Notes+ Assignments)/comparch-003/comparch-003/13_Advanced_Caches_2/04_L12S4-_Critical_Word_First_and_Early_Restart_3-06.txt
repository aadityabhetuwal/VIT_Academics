I'll just skip way prediction cuz I don't
think it's that important.
I did want to say one or two words about
critical word first and early restart.
So, critical word first, basic idea here
is that you can express to the memory
system which word is the most important
word.
And usually RAM arrays the buses are
oriented in a way that they'll actually
allow it takes multiple pumps or multiple
cycles to transmit the data across the
bus.
And usually, these arrays don't care at
least, like main memory, like, like, D-RAM
arrays, big, big thing on your, on your
chassis or on your system server
motherboard.
Cough They don't really care if they
return the data in this order, zero, one,
two, three, four, five, six, seven and
eight, Probably seven, Sorry.
Or, if you return it in a different order
because they just wanna use the bus as
much as possible.
So, what you can do is you can say, COUGH
address three is the most important one,
please return that first.
So, what can happen is it will return the
data and right here, address three comes
back, and it comes back first always,
being cuz that's the address that we're
trying to access for this loadness.
And can start the CPU executing again
while the rest of the cache line is
filling into the cache.
So you've basically done a little bit of
overlapping but this doesn't help that
much.
Because usually, you know, there's not
that many a cache line is not that long so
it might help you a little bit.
So, you know, if it takes eight cycles to
fill the cache, you might save seven
cycles if you were going to the last, if
you were trying to load the last word in
the cache line.
But if you were trying to, let's say, load
the second line in the cache line, it only
saves you one cycle.
And there is some complexity in actually
building critical word first systems.
Cough Early restart is another way to do
this which little less hardware.
Instead of having the memory system rotate
the memory that returns back to you, it
still returns the memory in the canonical
order.
But, we just wait until let's say, we want
to dress three here, it comes back and we
restart there.
So you can see there's a little bit of
time here which we could overlay it block
the fill in with executing in the CPU
again.
In the canonical case, if we don't have
early restart, what's going to happen is
we have to wait for the entire cache line
to come in and then we can restart, so we
lose, we lose these, these cycles there.
We don't get that overlap.
Okay. Let's stop here for today and I'm
going to remove the, the weight prediction
stuff from the material we talked about
cuz it's not that important.
