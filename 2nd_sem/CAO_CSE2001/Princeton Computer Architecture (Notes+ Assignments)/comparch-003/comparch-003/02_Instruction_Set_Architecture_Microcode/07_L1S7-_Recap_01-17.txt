So, to recap this is ELE 475 or Computer
Architecture class.
We're going to be focusing on abstraction
layers and talking about instruction set
architecture and microarchitecture,
register transfer language.
Little bit into operating systems and
little bit down into gates but we're
really trying to harness technology and
bring it to applications, or bring it into
what humans want to accomplish.
Today, we talked about ISA, or instruction
set architecture, versus
microarchitecture, or Big-A architecture
versus microarchitecture.
And we talked about some ISA
characteristics including machine models,
encoding, data types, what sort of
instructions you can have, addressing
modes, and encoding.
Next lecture, we're going to start off by
talking about microcode.
And then, move into our first review
lecture, which is review on how to build
pipeline processors, review on pipeline.
So with that, I'll end here and thank you
all for listening.
