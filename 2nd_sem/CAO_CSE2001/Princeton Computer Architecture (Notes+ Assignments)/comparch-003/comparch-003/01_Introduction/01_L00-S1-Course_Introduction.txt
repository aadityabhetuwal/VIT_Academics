Welcome to the encore offering of Computer
Architecture.
I'm David Wentzlaff, I'm a professor
at the Princeton Department of Electrical
Engineering.
And my background is building mini core
and
multi core microprocessors both in
academia and in industry.
And for example, this is one of the
microprocessors that I built while I was
in industry.
And this is actually a 64 core multi-core
microprocessor.
And that's actually put onto something
like this board here.
And you can see actually that that chip is
under this heat sink on this board here.
And in this course, you're going to be
learning how to
build processors with, sort of complexity
on the order of this.
We're not, in this course, trying to teach
you how to build basic processors.
We will overview basic processors and
basic in order pipeline processors,
but instead, in this course, we'll go into
much more detail about how to build
out of order sequential processors, how do
you build more advanced things, like
advanced caches?
How do you go about building vector
processors?
How do you exploit different
types of parallelism, like instructional
parallelism?
Thread level parallelism?
Process level parallelism?
Vector parallelism, etc.?
We'll also be going into detail about how
to build cache coherent systems.
And at the end of the course, we'll be
talking about how to build multi-core and
many-core microprocessors.
And I wanted to point out that this course
is an advanced computer architecture
course, so we'll be going into much more
detail, and we're going to be learning
how to build the inner working components,
for instance all the different structures
and
all the different algorithms you need in
order to build these advanced modern-day
microprocessors.
And we won't be spending as much time
looking at
how to build processors let's say from 20
or 30
years ago.
So in this on core offering, we're
going to
be extending where we were for our first
offering.
And in our first offering we had over
100,000 students registered.
And this was really successful.
We were very encouraged by this.
And we want this offering to be just as
successful.
So please, tell your friends.
If you're sitting here at the beginning of
this class, watching this video, and
saying I know of a friend who might
actually be helped by this course.
Let them know.
If they're interested in the field, let
them know.
Also if you're taking a computer
architecture
course at another university, and you
want to
use a supplemental materials, please sign
up and tell your friends to sign up.
We try to make this course also useful for
people who are currently taking a course
at other Universities.
So let's stop and take a look at the
philosophy of this course.
So in this course we're trying to have a
high quality course
similar to what we have at Princeton.
And this course is going to be rigorous,
so we're going to use good
text books, have hard problems, have a
hard mid-term and a hard final.
Now the trade-off here is that because
this course is going to be
so rigorous you're going to learn a lot
and it's going to be very rewarding.
But unlike, you know, other courses where
it
might just be a survey level course, this
is going to go into the details, and the
trade off there is you're going to learn
and
be able to apply this information in the
future of your life.
I wanted to, while we were talking about
rigor and sort of what goes about
into a course, I want to talk about the
two recommended textbooks for this course.
So the first recommended textbook is this
one here.
It's called Patterson and Hennessy.
you see that the two authors are Patterson
and Hennessey and
the title of the book is Computer
Architecture A Quantitative Approach.
We're going to be using the fifth edition
of this book, but
for those of you who, and I highly
recommend the fifth edition.
But for those of you who are not able to
acquire the
fifth edition or it's too expensive you're
going, you can also go
about and try to get the fourth edition of
the book, which
has we'll, we'll be posting equivalent
pages out of the fourth edition.
If they are valuable.
So there's some topics which are covered
only in
the fifth edition, but not in the fourth
edition.
also I wanted to say we will also be
posting
if there's a particular question that we
assign from a textbook.
We'll be paraphrasing or, or copying the
entire question on there.
We've had permission from the publisher to
do that.
The second book for this course we're
going to be
using is called Modern Processor Design
Fundamentals of Super-scalar Processors.
And we'll be talking about this as or
we'll be mentioning this and we coined
this Shennon-Leposty
book because these are the two authors of
this textbook.
I did want to point out that this version
here
which has a blue cover and is hardcover
has recently fallen
out of print as McGraw-Hill, who is the
publisher, but it
is being reissued by Wyvern Press in a
cheaper, paperback edition.
the paperback edition is going to have the
white cover and will be released very
soon and we'll post more details about
that
on the course website when it becomes
available.
For those of you who are joining in the
middle of
this course, we want to encourage you to,
to jump right in.
the mid term and the final we will have
open for
long periods to take the exams and also to
grade the exams.
But if you are just coming in the middle
and
you're like say joining like a week before
the midterm or
after the midterm we'll be posting the
answers to those
but we unfortunately can't have like
infinite numbers of midterms and
finals with full grading turned on.
So you're more than welcome to come join
the course.
Use it as a self study.
And we'll also be including after the
course
completes, we'll be leaving it open for
self study.
And for instance if you missed the midterm
but you make it
to this course for the final feel free to
take the final.
so, while this is the encore offering of
the course, I
wanted to talk a little bit about how
we've improved this course
since the first offering.
So, we'll actually we've re-taped several
of the lectures,
and we've fixed many different errata in
the slides.
And while I was speaking about errata, I
wanted to encourage you if you find
an error, somewhere in the course
material,
please log in and use the course forums.
Go to the course material errors forum,
and look through and
see, make sure that the error has not
already been posted.
But if it hasn't, please let
us know.
We really want to try to make this as best
as possible, this course.
So please go in there and post the
problems, and
we'll try to get 'em fixed as soon as
possible.
while I'm on the topic of forums, I also
wanted to
talk about, language and region specific
meet up groups, or study groups.
We have a location on our forums where
people can meet up and try
to post in there if they are from a
specific region or specific language.
I unfortunately
only speak English.
So I'm not going to be able to answer your
questions in another language.
But, your fellow students might be able to
help.
And it might actually help if you will,
you know, are able
to discuss the different problems in the
course, in a different, language.
So, look onto that website.
and look under the forum in that specific,
sub portion of
the forum to post and try to form meet up
groups.
In our first offering, we actually had.
Several, actually,
physical meet up groups in different
countries.
And we had language specific discussions
that were
quite in depth about problems, of this
course.
And it, from what we've heard, it
really help different, students from
around the world.
Also, one of the things I wanted to talk
about is surveys.
And this is a difference from our first
time, offering this course.
This time around, we're actually going to
be sending you surveys.
and at a regular basis.
So we want to be in the course we want to
probably work for
the mid term one right after the mid term
and a couple at the end.
And these of course are optional you don't
have to go and fill these out.
But what we're trying to do is we're
trying to understand
where the students who are taking our
course are coming from.
Both in location but also background and
preparation.
And one of the reasons we're doing this is
to better tune the course for the future.
And make the course much better in the
future.
But also,
we're trying to research, and actively
figure out
how to better teach computer architecture
in the future.
And also just about how to teach in a
massively open online course environment
better in the future.
Finally, I wanted to talk about.
Princeton Electrical Engineering
Department.
And all the very strong computer
engineering and
computer architecture faculty members at
Princeton electrical engineering.
So if you're going and taking this course,
and you're really enjoying the course.
And you're learning.
And you're, you say, I want to continue
doing this in the future.
And if you're, for instance, a senior in
undergraduate.
Please apply to Princeton Electrical
Engineering.
Come and, learn.
And figure out how to build better and
better microprocessors in the future.
We currently have, five faculty member.
Both in the electrical engineering
department, and the computer science
department.
Who focus on, computer architecture.
So we have.
Tens of graduate students and
also, as I said, five computer
architecture
faculties and computer engineering is
located in
the electrical engineering department, so
please come
and apply to the electrical engineering
department.
We also have circuits professors and a
bunch of software professors over
in the computer science department, and we
are a top ranked school.
Our submission deadline for application
process is December 15th.
Thank you, and I look forward to having a
very successful course with you.
